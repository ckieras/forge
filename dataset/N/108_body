Dear Andy, 
Have been reading about the troubles at Enron, hope this hasn't affected your job. 
Are you and Dick going to Omaha for Christmas? Lisa, Billy and Madison will be here on the 23rd and stay for about a week. Steve, Lenora and the boys can't come until the week after Christmas. It's a very busy time of year for Steve, at work.  
Lori, Jeff and their families will be here as usual. 
Did you have a good Thanksgiving? We had a nice quiet day, just Lori, Jeff and their families. Lisa and Billy stayed in Austin this year as it has been a very busy football season for them. 
Jeff and Marsha are back together and seem to be getting along very well. They got a new puppy last week. It's an 11 week old female, yellow Labrador. They named her Gypsy. She is really cute but is going to get pretty big. Oh well, not my problem. 
Hope this finds you and Dick doing well. 
Love, Aunt Mary Lou 
P.S. Uncle Bob sends his love. 
P.P.S. Come see us anytime!!!!
